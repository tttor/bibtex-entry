abstract="Considering Markovian Decision Processes (MDPs), the meaning of an optimal policy depends on the optimality criterion chosen. The most common approach is to define the optimal policy as the one that maximizes the sum of discounted rewards. The intuitive alternative is to maximize the average reward per step. The former has strong convergence guarantees but suffers from the dependency on a discount factor. The latter has the additional inconvenience of being insensitive to different policies with equivalent average. This paper analyzes the impact of such different criteria on a series of experiments, and then provides a threshold for the discount factor in order to ensure average optimality for discounted-optimal policies in the deterministic case.",
