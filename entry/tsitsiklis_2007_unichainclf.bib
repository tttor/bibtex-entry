abstract = "The unichain condition requires that every policy in an MDP result in a single ergodic class, and guarantees that the optimal average cost is independent of the initial state. We show that checking whether the unichain condition fails to hold is an NP-complete problem. We conclude with a brief discussion of the merits of the more general weak accessibility condition."
