abstract="In this chapter we will first describe the basic HF approach, and then examine well-known performance-improving techniques such as preconditioning which we have found to be beneficial for neural network training, as well as others of a more heuristic nature which are harder to justify, but which we have found to work well in practice. We will also provide practical tips for creating efficient and bug-free implementations and discuss various pitfalls which may arise when designing and using an HF-type approach in a particular application.",
