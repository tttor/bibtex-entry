abstract = "Real-world optimisation problems are often very complex. Metaheuristics have been successful in solving many of these problems, but the difficulty in choosing the best approach can be a huge challenge for practitioners. One approach to this dilemma is to use fitness landscape analysis to better understand problems before deciding on approaches to solving the problems. However, despite extensive research on fitness landscape analysis and a large number of developed techniques, very few techniques are used in practice. This could be because fitness landscape analysis in itself can be complex. In an attempt to make fitness landscape analysis techniques accessible, this paper provides an overview of techniques from the 1980s to the present. Attributes that are important for practical implementation are highlighted and ways of adapting techniques to be more feasible or appropriate are suggested. The survey reveals the wide range of factors that can influence problem difficulty, emphasising the need for a shift in focus away from predicting problem hardness towards measuring characteristics. It is hoped that this survey will invoke renewed interest in the field of understanding complex optimisation problems and ultimately lead to better decision making on the use of appropriate metaheuristics."
