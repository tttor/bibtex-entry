abstract = "We consider an approximation scheme for solving Markov decision processes (MDPs) with countable state space, finite action space, and bounded rewards that uses an approximate solution of a fixed finite-horizon sub-MDP of a given infinite-horizon MDP to create a stationary policy, which we call “approximate receding horizon control.” We first analyze the performance of the approximate receding horizon control for infinite-horizon average reward under an ergodicity assumption, which also generalizes the result obtained by White (J. Oper. Res. Soc. 33 (1982) 253–259). We then study two examples of the approximate receding horizon control via lower bounds to the exact solution to the sub-MDP. The first control policy is based on a finite-horizon approximation of Howard's policy improvement of a single policy and the second policy is based on a generalization of the single policy improvement for multiple policies. Along the study, we also provide a simple alternative proof on the policy improvement for countable state space. We finally discuss practical implementations of these schemes via simulation."
