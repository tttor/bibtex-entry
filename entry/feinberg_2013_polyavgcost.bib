abstract = "This note considers an average-cost Markov Decision Process (MDP) with finite state and action sets and satisfying the additional condition that there is a state to which the system jumps from any state and under any action with a positive probability. The main result is that the policy iteration algorithm is strongly polynomial for such MDPs, which are often used to model replacement and maintenance problems."
